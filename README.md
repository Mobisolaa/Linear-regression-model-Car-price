## Linear-regression-model-Car-price
A model aimed at establishing the features with the highest predictive power in determining the price of a second-hand Nissan Qashqai.  Specifically focusing on Wolverhampton UK market.
## Introduction
The study started by examining the car based on its characteristics and popularity to obtain a general understanding. Sample data of 85 cars with a maximum age of 5 years was taken from WV4 6BD +10 miles environment to help draw the conclusions. The age of the cars were restricted to 5 years because that is a close range - including wider years creates a possibility that the sample would contain extremely higher prices or extremely lower prices, and as such can distort the overall conclusions. 
## Tools utilized
- Excel was used for data cleaning and manipulation 
- SPSS was used for analysis and model building . 
## Data Visualization
Graphical representations were used to tell stories of the data in a very simple format with efficiency and precision.

## Hypothesis Testing 
The statistics of the data show that the average price is £16,909, and it was derived that there is a 95% chance that the average market price of the second Nissan Qashqai in the UK is between £16,693 and £17,125. To ascertain this, price was obtained from the public domain and a one sample T test was conducted, the results showed no significant difference between the average UK price and the mean price calculated in our sample.
